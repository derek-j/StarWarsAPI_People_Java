Some Personal Context about this programming challenge:
-------------------------------------------------------
I realize some people might come across these examples from others.  Let me add a little context:
I have used Java for Rest API endpoint testing and used the standard JAVA HTTP libraries.  It has been a few 
years since doing that.  During the past several years, most of my work has been using Python, which makes it 
very easy to do REST API development/testing.  For fun, I wrote some quick tests in Python.  Took maybe an hour 
total.  However I knew they wanted it done in Java.  Since it had been a few years I wanted to see if Java had 
better tools/libraries to do this than I used previously.  I came across RestAssured.  In just about an hour, 
I had figured out Rest Assured and had some tests running with the RestAssured framework.  RestAssured simplifies  
REST API’s testing. 

So I wrote these with RestAssured as first time I have used it, but it only took a few hours total, I then added 
some custom code as well, in the final test case, to Marshall/Unmarshall JSON Strings to Java Objects.  As a 
demonstration of getting even better access to data we might need or want to test.  
Through my vast experience, I pick up new technologies really quickly and can make effective use of them quickly.  
This is an example of that.
The Engineering Director was very pleased, said I was the only person whom he has assigned this too who didn’t 
need help and gave the best solution he had seen.  Unfortunately he just offered the position to another person 
who had the exact skill set he was looking for.  The story hasn’t ended yet here!  He really wants to bring me 
on and is trying to make that happen.
