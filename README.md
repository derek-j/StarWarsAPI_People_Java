Assignment was to write 5 test cases to test the StarWars People REST API https://swapi.co/documentation#people 
These are three People Endpoints which are read-only:

- /people/ -- get all the people resources
- /people/:id/ -- get a specific people resource
- /people/schema/ -- view the JSON schema for this resource
